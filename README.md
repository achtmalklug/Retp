Retp - R functions for estimating potential evapo-traspiration and more

This package provides functions to estimate daily potential evapo-transpiration based on location (lon/lat), date, and weather (temperature, humidity, wind) using the approaches by Penman and Monteith (1965) (with FAO grass reference ETP as special case), Priesley and Taylor (1972), Hargreaves and Samani (1985).

This is published in an early development stage. Next to follow:
- a vignette
- smart treatment of incomplete weather data
- estimation for sub-daily periods
